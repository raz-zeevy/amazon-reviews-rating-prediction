Good quality liner, perfect for our 4 year olds... see some additional tricks/tips in the review!","So far so good, we started opening and setting up on the grass, from there we decided the more level concrete slab would be a better & cleaner area to set the pool on so we drained the little we did fill in a few min and it went up on the patio fairly easily and in a matter of minutes.  After huffing and puffing for the first 5 min.  I was able to get the upper support ring at the top/rim inflated.  From there I smoothed out the bottom of the heavy vinyl liner and started to fill, during the first 15 min I gently stretched out the vinyl liner gently smoothing it out as it filled, the first 10-15 min is fine, after that the weight of the water will be too much to be able to stretch out the liner bottom any further.

All in all It took about 30-40 min to completely fill the pool to the top rim.  While filling you will need to get those hoses in place as the water rises to the area the hose ports are it will start to drain out the hoses unless the hoses are attached with the clamps provided to the pump etc.  the entire thing is fairly simple to hook up, take your time identifying the pump hose parts listed in the instructions as they are illustrated very small and a little difficult to identify, once you understand the sequence/route for the hoses it should be fairly easy to finish up.

I have to say for the price this is a really nice little pool!  Being someone who admires the genius of a good design I appreciated the pool probably a bit more than most, the design itself is brilliant, large stable bottom and the sides of the pool taper/are smaller in circumference traveling up toward the top or rim of the pool, which gives it a good stable side without any additional support such as a frame, rim itself is basically an inflatable doughnut which contributes significantly to the stabilization of the pool as inflatables float, the inflatable rim is constantly pulling upward ensuring the sides always return to their intended position holding in the water no matter if someone pushes the rim down allowing water to escape during getting in or out of the pool.

It doesn't come with any sort of ladder or way in or out other than pushing down the upper rim/doughnut so it's nice to be able to squish down the rim and step over, yes some water spills out each time but the inflatable rim ensures the water loss is minimum as it always returns to its correct position stopping further water loss each time.  Brilliant!  In case you can't tell I really like this thing!

It's big enough for an adult to sit in it and being 6'3"" the water Lime would fall somewhere around my neck area.  A 4 year old child of 37"" is able to stand in the pool and have the water just below their chin or neck area, so it's nice they are mostly submersed with the option of always standing up if they have a problem.  Always watch your child, NEVER leave them alone even for a second as it doesn't take long for a child to drowned.  As long as you're there and your child is tall enough to stand and have the water fall below their chin, they should be fine playing inside the pool by themselves with you watching.

Ive included an updated photo, the fittings do leak a bit if the clamps are not positioned directly over the rubber o-ring as the clamps are installed.  Even so the plastic clamps really aren't able to ensure a leak proof fit.  If this isn't something youd be able to live with, Id recommend getting better steel clamps in place of he provided plastic ones.

NOTE:  If you appreciated this review please give it a thumbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products Ive used and you may have questions about.  Interested in a product but don't know enough about it and would like it reviewed?  Please let me know and I'll see what I can do... Thank you ",418,9.498956847470653
